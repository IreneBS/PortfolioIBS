Irene Borra Serrano obtained her PhD in Bioscience Engineering from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven) in Belgium, which was successfully defended in November 2020. She is a forestry engineer with a specialization in remote sensing applied to forest management (M.Sc Geomética, Teledetección y Modelos Espaciales Aplicados a la Gestión Forestal - University of Córdoba (UCO)). From January 2023 to December 2024, Irene worked as Juan de la Cierva post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of Agricultural Sciences (ICA-CSIC) in the Geospatial and Precision Technologies for Sustainable Agriculture group (Tech4Agro) within the plant protection department. She is currently working in the project ECODigital. Her main research line is to develop technical solutions to support management decisions related to crop status and varieties in breeding programs and agricultural fields based on remote sensing data and open-source tools.
